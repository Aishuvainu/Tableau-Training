TABLEAU TRAINING
  PROJECT-COMPARATIVE STUDY OF COUNTRIES:
          IN this project we can use muliple steps and formulas:
step 1
   i can upload two data sets 
      1.global financial devlopment database
      2.insurance sample datasets
step2
   i can use geographical map in sheet1 and i used colour selves,size selves and detail selves and also used filters
step 3 
    created KPI table and KPI shapes
    i can create a two parameters one is selected category and another one is selected year.
step 4
     FORMULAS
     Growth%=avg([Select YYYY])-avg([Previous YYYY])
     Growth indicators = IF [Growth %]>0.0001 THEN "Positive"
                         ELSEIF [Growth %]<-0.001 THEN "Negative"
                         ELSE"No change"
                         END
     Previous YYYY = IF INT([Year])=YEAR([Select year]-1)THEN [Selected category]END
     Select YYYY = IF INT([Year])=YEAR([Select year])THEN [Selected category]END
     Selected year = CASE[Select category]
                     WHEN 1 THEN[Life insurance share]
                     WHEN 2 THEN[Market share > Total]
                     WHEN 3 THEN[Penetration > Total]
                     WHEN 4 THEN[Ratio of reinsurance accepted > Total]
                     WHEN 5 THEN[Retention ratio > Total]
                     END
when i change the year or selected category the chart will automatically changed
kpi shapes i used multiple shapes and put it different colors for positive,negative and no change
step 5
 create the Trend line 
    used line charts and use triangle shapes
step 6
     finally i can create the dashboard     i can create a multiple dashboards and different  filters ,fonts ,tittile colors ,size and i create Wikipedia finally i done my project and 
submited.
